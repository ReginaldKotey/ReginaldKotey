**Hello!, I am Reginald 👋🏾**

I’m an aspiring software engineer with a passion for web development, design, application development, and computer security. As a student at New York University, I've had the chance to dive deep into data structures, algorithms, and programming languages like C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and React. My internship at the University of Cape Coast as a Network Software Engineering Intern also allowed me to sharpen my networking and security skills. I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skill set as I progress through my academic and professional journey.
